            Curious about me? Here you have it:
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            I am a passionate, self-taught developer who specializes in
            React.js, Next.js, and HeadlessCMS. I am enthusiastic about bringing
            both the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life,
            prioritizing user experience, pixel-perfect development, and writing
            clear, readable, and highly performant code.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            My web development journey began in 2020, and since then, I have
            continuously grown and evolved as a developer, embracing new
            challenges and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Now, in my mid-twenties, three years after starting my web
            development journey, I am proficient in building cutting-edge web
            applications using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript,
            Tailwind CSS, Prisma, and HeadlessCMS (like Strapi.io). As a
            progressive thinker, I thoroughly enjoy working on projects from
            ideation to development, taking complete ownership of the
            product&apos;s creation.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Apart from being in full-on developer mode, I also have a keen
            interest in traveling, reading books, and researching fundamental
            truths about reality and the universe.
          </Typography>
